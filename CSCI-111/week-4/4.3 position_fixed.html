         The Ancient Olympic Games stadium in Olympia, Greece
         The Ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: τὰ Ὀλύμπια, ta Olympia[8]) were religious and athletic festivals 
         held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The date of the festival was determined 
         according to a complicated formula whereby the midpoint of the festival would occur during the second full 
         moon after the summer solstice—usually late August or early September.[9]: p. 26 [10]: p. 38  
         This "came after the annual harvest but before the picking of the olives."[10] 
         Heralds were sent from Elis to announce the dates.[9]: p. 26 [10]: p. 38  
         Competition at first was among only "legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents."[10]: p. 49  
         However, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened the earlier 
         standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate.[10]: p. 50  Tens of thousands of Greeks 
         would make the difficult journey to attend the festival.[9]: p. 55  Some sources say as many as 40,000 
         attended.[11][12] These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and 
         the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, 
         all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. 
         This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.[13] This idea is a modern 
         myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims 
         who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected 
         by Zeus.[14] See also Finley and Pleket.[9]: pp. 98–99 

         The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;[15]: p. 12  one of the most popular myths 
         identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games.[15]: pp. 12–13 [16][17][18] 
         According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games "Olympic" and established the custom of 
         holding them every four years.[17] The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, 
         he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line 
         for 200 steps and called this distance a "stadion" (Ancient Greek: στάδιον, Latin: stadium, "stage"), 
         which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics 
         is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every 
         four years starting in 776 BC.[2] For the first thirteen Olympics, the stadion footrace was the only event 
         contested,[10]: p. 145 [19] and victory in that sprint was so valued that the next Olympiad was named after 
         the winner, e.g. "the third year of the eighteenth Olympiad when Ladas of Argos won the stadion."[10]: p. 145  
         The Ancient Games varied over time, but they came to feature running events, 
         a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), 
         boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events.[20][21] Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from 
         the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion,[22] which indicates that the competition was not limited 
         to the aristocracy.[10]: pp. 50–51 

         The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held alongside ritual 
         sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops 
         (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the festival's second day.[9]: p. 15  
         (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.[23]) The winners of the events 
         were admired and immortalised in poems and statues.[24] Although a wreath made from the sacred olive 
         tree in the precinct of Zeus was the only official prize at the Olympic Games, winners' fame brought them 
         economic wealth, too, in the form of subsidies from their hometowns and wealthy sponsors. See, e.g., 
         Finley and Pleket,[9]: pp. 24, 76–82  and Perrottet[10]: pp. 13–14  The Games were held every four years,
          and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. 
          The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, 
          the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.[25]

         The Olympic Games reached the height of their success in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, 
         but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. 
         While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date 
         is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.[b] 
         Another date commonly cited is 426 AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all 
         Greek temples.[26]
