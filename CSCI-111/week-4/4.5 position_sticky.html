         <h1>Cost of the Games</h1>
         <h2>See also: Cost of the Olympic Games</h2>
         <p>
            The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 found that, since 1960, sports-related costs for the Summer Games 
            were on average US$5.2 billion and for the Winter Games $3.1 billion. These figures do not include 
            wider infrastructure costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost as much or more 
            than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games were Beijing 2008 at US$40â€“44 billion,[69] 
            and the most expensive Winter Games were Sochi 2014 at US$51 billion.[70][71] As of 2016, 
            costs per athlete were, on average, US$599,000 for the Summer Games and $1.3 million for the Winter Games; 
            for London 2012, the cost per athlete was $1.4 million, and the figure was $7.9 million for Sochi 2014.[71]

            Where ambitious construction for the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow 
            had burdened organisers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled 
            expenses for the 1984 Summer Games by using existing facilities and only two new that were paid for by 
            corporate sponsors. The Organizing Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow 
            the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports 
            library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered until that date, the most financially successful 
            modern Olympics and a model for future Games.[72]

            Budget overruns are common for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real terms,[73] 
            which means that actual costs turned out to be on average 2.56 times the budget that was estimated at the 
            time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost overrun for Summer Games, 
            and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost overrun for Winter Games, at 324%. 
            London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.[71]

            It has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution, 
            which means that, first, the Games are prone to large cost overruns and, second, it is only a matter 
            of time until an overrun occurs that is larger than the largest to date. In short, hosting the Games 
            is economically and financially extremely risky.[74]

            The final cost for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was reported to be JPY 1,423.8 billion (US$13 billion). 
            This was achieved by balancing revenues and expenditures through various efforts to increase revenue 
            and continuously review expenditures. The primary sources of revenue included the International Olympic 
            Committee (IOC) contribution of JPY 86.8 billion (US$0.8 billion), TOP sponsorship of JPY 56.9 billion 
            (US$0.5 billion), local sponsorship of JPY 376.1 billion (US$3.4 billion), an insurance payout of JPY 50 
            billion (US$0.5 billion) for the postponement of the Games, and other sources including licensing. 
            The expenditures included JPY 195.5 billion (US$1.8 billion) for venue-related costs and 
            JPY 444.9 billion (US$4 billion) for service expenditures. The total cost also accounted for 
            COVID-19 countermeasures amounting to JPY 35.3 billion (US$0.3 billion). Despite initial estimates, 
            the total costs were reduced by JPY 220.2 billion (US$2 billion) from the budget announced in 
            December 2020, and JPY 29.2 billion (US$0.3 billion) from the estimated budget in December 2021. 
            This successful financial management resulted in a balanced budget for the Tokyo 2020 Games.[75][76]

            Economic and social impact on host cities and countries
            Seeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to 
            establish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about sociocultural 
            impacts of the Olympic Games.[77][78] He felt that the Olympics "is worthy of study because it is one of 
            the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and other problems associated 
            with it".[77] He began Olympika in 1992, the first peer-reviewed academic journal focused on 
            the Olympic Games.[79][80] The International Society of Olympic Historians was founded in 1991, 
            which publishes the Journal of Olympic History.[81]

            Some economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, 
            emphasising that such "mega-events" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits 
            in the long run.[82] Hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's 
            exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host 
            the Games.[83] Research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a positive effect on the 
            philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the 
            local nonprofit sector. This effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for 
            several years afterwards, though not permanently.[84]

            The Games have had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing 
            Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, 
            often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.[85] The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the 
            most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the 
            European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released at the time of the games, the cost would 
            not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar 
            region of Russia as a result of improved services. But by December 2014, eight months after the games 
            The Guardian stated that Sochi "now feels like a ghost town", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums 
            and arenas and the still-unfinished infrastructure.[86] At least four cities withdrew their bids for 
            the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or lack of local support,[87] resulting in only a two-city 
            race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Guardian stated 
            that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is few cities or countries want to host them.[88] 
            Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took 
            the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles. 
            Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking 
            number of existing and temporary facilities.[89]
