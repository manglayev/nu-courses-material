      <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>
      <p>
         Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):
      </p>
      <div>
         You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.

            Al-Khwarizmi's work on arithmetic was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals, 
            based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system developed in Indian mathematics, to the Western world. 
            The term "algorithm" is derived from the algorism, the technique of performing arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic 
            numerals developed by al-Khwārizmī. Both "algorithm" and "algorism" are derived from the Latinized 
            forms of al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi and Algorismi, respectively.
