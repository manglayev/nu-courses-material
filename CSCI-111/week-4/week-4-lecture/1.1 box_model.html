      <h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>
      <p>
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.
      </p>
      <div id="div-1">
         <div id="div-2">
            <p>This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border.</p>
            <p>
               Al-Khwārizmī's second most influential work was on the subject of arithmetic, 
               which survived in Latin translations but is lost in the original Arabic. 
               His writings include the text kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī ('Book of Indian computation), 
               and perhaps a more elementary text, kitab al-jam' wa'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī ('Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic').
               These texts described algorithms on decimal numbers (Hindu–Arabic numerals) that could be carried out on a dust board. 
               Called takht in Arabic (Latin: tabula), a board covered with a thin layer of dust or sand was employed for calculations, 
               on which figures could be written with a stylus and easily erased and replaced when necessary. 
               Al-Khwarizmi's algorithms were used for almost three centuries, 
               until replaced by Al-Uqlidisi's algorithms that could be carried out with pen and paper.
