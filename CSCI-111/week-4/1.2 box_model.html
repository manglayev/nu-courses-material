      <h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>
      <p>
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.
      </p>
      <div id="div-1">
        <p>This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border.</p>
        As part of 12th century wave of Arabic science flowing into Europe via translations, 
        these texts proved to be revolutionary in Europe. 
        Al-Khwarizmi's Latinized name, Algorismus, turned into the name of method used for computations, 
        and survives in the term "algorithm". It gradually replaced the previous abacus-based methods used in Europe.
      </div>
      <div id="div-2">
        <p>This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 50px margin and a 15px green border.</p>
        Four Latin texts providing adaptions of Al-Khwarizmi's methods have survived, 
        even though none of them is believed to be a literal translation:
        Dixit Algorizmi (published in 1857 under the title Algoritmi de Numero Indorum)
        Liber Alchoarismi de Practica Arismetice
        Liber Ysagogarum Alchorismi
        Liber Pulveris
        Dixit Algorizmi ('Thus spake Al-Khwarizmi') is the starting phrase of a manuscript 
        in the University of Cambridge library, which is generally referred to by its 1857 title Algoritmi de Numero Indorum. 
        It is attributed to the Adelard of Bath, who had translated the astronomical tables in 1126. 
        It is perhaps the closest to Al-Khwarizmi's own writings.
