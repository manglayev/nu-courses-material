To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much
Just rememeber two main rules for the beginning:
You better starve, than eat whatever
And better be alone, than with whoever.

<pre id="p-2-poem">
Five things in life there are you should shun and ban.  
Five other things there are that you should strive to gain,
If you have made your aim to be a worthy man.
And know - if you try hard your goals you will attain.

My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
My heart’s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.

Sable clouds by tempest driven,
Snowflakes whirling in the gales,
Hark—it sounds like grim wolves howling,
Hark—now like a child it wails!
Creeping through the rustling straw thatch,
Rattling on the mortared walls,
Like some weary wanderer knocking—
On the lowly pane it falls.
