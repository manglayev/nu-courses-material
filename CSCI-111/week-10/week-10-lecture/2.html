To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much
Just rememeber two main rules for the beginning:
You better starve, than eat whatever
And better be alone, than with whoever.

Five things in life there are you should shun and ban.  
Five other things there are that you should strive to gain,
If you have made your aim to be a worthy man.
And know - if you try hard your goals you will attain.

My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
My heart’s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.

<pre id="p-4-poem">
Sable clouds by tempest driven,
Snowflakes whirling in the gales,
Hark—it sounds like grim wolves howling,
Hark—now like a child it wails!
Creeping through the rustling straw thatch,
Rattling on the mortared walls,
Like some weary wanderer knocking—
On the lowly pane it falls.
