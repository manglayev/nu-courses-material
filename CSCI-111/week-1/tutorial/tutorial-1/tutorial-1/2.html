            The programmer
            she said, our life is a journey of accomplishments,
            
            That we were programmed, we were trained
                For what it has to come the other day
            And at sudden something went fortunately wrong
                    And now we are nothing but some strayed unfixable bugs
            That no one seems to care about
            Did we fail to compile?
